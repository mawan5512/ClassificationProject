# Patient Classification
This project trains many classification models to predict whether a diabetes patient will be readmitted in greater than or less than 30 days or not at all. 
# How it works
The prediction.py file preprocesses the data in diabetes_data.csv and returns the processed data ready to be used to as training and testing for the classification model.Variables can be changes to fine tune the data preprocessing.
Each of the pred_###.py files train a specific classification model and return the accuracy score given its predictions.
