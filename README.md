# cs5810-project
Hey man I would suggest using jupyter notebook and just using the ipynb file I uploaded. I think there are some finnikcy things if you just open the .py file and try to run that in an IDE, but I put both on here in case you wanna work on either. 
Also I uploaded the presentation with a few slides already in there. Lemme know when you make some progress on it and I'll do what I can too
